## COMMUNITY RULES

### The "tl;dr" version:

Don't be a jerk.
Don't spoil the fun.
Like this game? Help us out.


### The "I need it spelled out for me" version:

Attack the person, not the problem (if you want to get banned). Not feeling 
friendly? Then be tactful. Politeness is the most acceptable form of hypocrisy. Take it easy, be respectful, especially when saying they made a mistake.

No bigotry of any kind. No discrimination, no slurs, no hate speech. "Joking" is not an excuse. 

No NSFW content, no illegal content, no spamming, no doxxing. No unrelated politics. Politics is the mind killer.

Spoilers are ruinous. Maintain the Veil Protocol. (If you're in a public area, don't link to it, don't meme about it, don't talk about it, don't hint at it, don't even THINK about it. Take your amnestic.)

This game is open source. Instead of complaining about how it doesn't have that secret sauce that would make it perfect, maybe donate some money or time to help add it?
